#
# 2.8 CSRF protection from remote <script> tags
#
# Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection now covers
# GET requests with JavaScript responses, too. That prevents
# a third-party site from referencing your JavaScript URL
# and attempting to run it to extract sensitive data.
#
# This means any of your tests that hit .js URLs will now
# fail CSRF protection unless they use xhr. Upgrade your tests
# to be explicit about expecting XmlHttpRequests. Instead of
# `post :create, format: :js`, switch to the explicit
# `xhr :post, :create, format: :js`

# EXPLANATION: What is a 302 ?
# NOTE: DO NOT CHANGE THE REST METHOD ON A REDIRECT
# http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html
# 10.3.3 302 Found
# The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI.
# Since the redirection might be altered on occasion, the client
# SHOULD continue to use the Request-URI for future requests.
# This response is only cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or
# Expires header field. The temporary URI SHOULD be given by the
# Location field in the response. Unless the request method was HEAD,
# the entity of the response SHOULD contain a short hypertext note
# with a hyperlink to the new URI(s).
#
# If the 302 status code is received in response to a request other than GET or HEAD,
# # the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the request unless it can be
# # confirmed by the user, since this might change the conditions under which the
# # request was issued.
# #
# # Note: RFC 1945 and RFC 2068 specify that the client is not allowed
# #      to change the method on the redirected request.  However, most
# #      existing user agent implementations treat 302 as if it were a 303
# #      response, performing a GET on the Location field-value regardless
# #      of the original request method. The status codes 303 and 307 have
# #      been added for servers that wish to make unambiguously clear which
# #      kind of reaction is expected of the client.

# https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To:-Test-controllers-with-Rails-3-and-4-(and-RSpec)
# Authenticated routes in Rails 3
#
# If you choose to authenticate in routes.rb,
# # you lose the ability to test your routes via
# #  assert_routing (which combines
# #   assert_recognizes and
# #    assert_generates, so you lose them also).
#
# It's a limitation in Rails: Rack runs first and checks your routing information
# # but since functional/controller tests run at the controller level,
# #  you cannot provide authentication information to Rack which means
# #   request.env['warden'] is nil and Devise generates one of the following errors:
#
# NoMethodError: undefined method 'authenticate!' for nil:NilClass
# NoMethodError: undefined method 'authenticate?' for nil:NilClass
#
# The SOLUTION is to test authenticated routes in the controller tests.
# # To do this, stub out your authentication methods for the controller test,
# #  as described here: How-To: Stub authentication in controller specs.
# TODO: this still needs to be done to resolve the remaining failing tests
# # that are failing with the NoMethodError described above : 20160504 - ko
