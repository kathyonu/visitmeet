    # 1.1.  Roles : OAuth defines four roles:
    #
    # # resource owner   : An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource.
    # #                    When the resource owner is a person, it is referred to as an end-user.
    # #
    # # resource server  : The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting
    # #                    and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.
    # #
    # # client           : An application making protected resource requests on behalf of the
    # #                    resource owner and with its authorization.  The term "client" does not
    # #                    imply any particular implementation characteristics (e.g., whether
    # #                    the application executes on a server, a desktop, or other devices).
    # #
    # # authorization server : The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully
    # #                        authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.
    # #
    # # The interaction between the authorization server and resource server
    # # is beyond the scope of this specification.  The authorization server
    # # may be the same server as the resource server or a separate entity.
    # # A single authorization server may issue access tokens accepted by
    # # multiple resource servers.
    # # # # #
    #
    # Define: Access token : The access token allows you to make requests to the API on a behalf of a user.
    # #     : USAGE: `GET https://api.github.com/user?access_token=...`
    # #    : You can pass the token in the query params like shown above, but
    # #   :  a cleaner approach is to include it in the Authorization header:

    # Web Application Flow

    # This is a description of the OAuth2 flow from 3rd party web sites.
    # 1. Redirect users to request GitHub access

    # `GET https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize`

    # Parameters
    # Name         | Type   | Description
    # client_id    | string | Required. The client ID you received from GitHub when you registered.
    # # https://github.com/settings/applications/new
    #
    # redirect_uri | string | The URL in your app where users will be sent after authorization.
    # # See details below about redirect urls : https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#redirect-urls
    #
    # scope        | string | A comma separated list of scopes.
    # # If not provided, scope defaults to an empty list of scopes for users that don't have a valid token for the app.
    # #  For users who do already have a valid token for the app, the user won't be shown the OAuth authorization page
    # #   with the list of scopes. Instead, this step of the flow will automatically complete with the same scopes
    # #    that were used last time the user completed the flow.
    #
    # state        | string | An unguessable random string.
    # # It is used to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks.
    #
    # allow_signup | string | Whether or not unauthenticated users will be offered an option to sign up for GitHub
    # # during the OAuth flow. The default is true. Use false in the case that a policy prohibits signups.
    #
    # 2. GitHub redirects back to your site
    # If the user accepts your request, GitHub redirects back to your site with a temporary code in a code parameter
    # # as well as the state you provided in the previous step in a state parameter. If the states don't match,
    # #  the request has been created by a third party and the process should be aborted.
    #
    # Exchange this for an access token:
    # `POST https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token`
    # # ref : https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#2-github-redirects-back-to-your-site

    # Parameters :
    # # Name        |  Type | Description
    # client_id       string  Required. The client ID you received from GitHub when you registered.
    # client_secret   string  Required. The client secret you received from GitHub when you registered.
    # code            string  Required. The code you received as a response to Step 1.
    # redirect_uri    string  The URL in your app where users will be sent after authorization.
    #                         See details below about redirect urls.
    # state           string  The unguessable random string you optionally provided in Step 1.
    #
    # Response
    # By default, the response will take the following form:
    #
    # access_token=e72e16c7e42f292c6912e7710c838347ae178b4a&scope=user%2Cgist&token_type=bearer
    #
    # You can also receive the content in different formats depending on the Accept header:
    #
    # Accept: application/json
    # {"access_token":"e72e16c7e42f292c6912e7710c838347ae178b4a", "scope":"repo,gist", "token_type":"bearer"}
    #
    # Accept: application/xml
    # <OAuth>
    #   <token_type>bearer</token_type>
    #   <scope>repo,gist</scope>
    #   <access_token>e72e16c7e42f292c6912e7710c838347ae178b4a</access_token>
    # </OAuth>

    # ref: https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/
    # 3. Use the access token to access the API
    #
    # The access token allows you to make requests to the API on a behalf of a user.
    #
    # GET https://api.github.com/user?access_token=...
    #
    # You can pass the token in the query params like shown above,
    # # but a cleaner approach is to include it in the Authorization header
    #
    # `Authorization: token OAUTH-TOKEN`
    #
    # For example, in curl you can set the Authorization header like this:
    #
    # curl -H "Authorization: token OAUTH-TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user
    #
    #
    # Redirect URLs
    #
    # The redirect_uri parameter is optional.
    # If left out, GitHub will redirect users to the callback URL configured in the OAuth Application settings.
    # If provided, the redirect URL's host and port must exactly match the callback URL.
    # The redirect URL's path must reference a subdirectory of the callback URL.
    #
    # CALLBACK: http://example.com/path
    #
    # GOOD: http://example.com/path
    # GOOD: http://example.com/path/subdir/other
